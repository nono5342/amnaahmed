                <p>A few years ago, I was sitting with my sister late at night, talking about something or the other, when we discovered a fundamental difference between us—that I spent a lot of my time in introspection, thinking about the way I think and feel, analyzing my own psyche, when she rarely did. She felt like thinking that deeply that often was a chore that brought nothing but distress and anxiety, the human mind being turtles all the way down. That had floored me, because to me at the time, there was simply no other way to live. I couldn’t imagine not spending every waking moment psychoanalyzing myself. </p>

                <p>Now, I have no idea who is the normal one between me and my sister, or if, perhaps, we are the two extremes on a spectrum on which most other people lie somewhere in the middle. Setting that mystery aside: it’s been a long time since I thought about anything deeper than the events of my day and, to a lesser degree, the media I have consumed. Not only is this out of my character, but it goes directly against it, flashing back to my genuine shock at my sister’s lack of desire to overthink her thoughts and feelings to shreds (I’ll call it meta-thinking).</p>

                <p>I frankly can’t recall if the switching off of my meta-thinking happened gradually or suddenly. I can’t even recall when it did, or the last time I had a meta-thought. Could it have been that I had too much free time at my hands prior to that point, and that getting caught up in moving abroad and starting university left me no time or luxury to ponder? Or do I perhaps still do ponder, but in a way so distinct from how I used to that I feel a certain loss when thinking about it? That’s a rather wordy way to put it, but I think it may be it.</p>

                <p>Come to think of it, I do still think. A lot. But it feels like my thoughts have been less coherent lately, and their trains never really reach a destination—going off rails, getting wrecked, or simply skidding to a halt. I do still think, but my thoughts don’t seem to leave their mark on situations, problems, not even in me. Thinking no longer results in growth, even if it arouses the same uncomfortable feelings that usually accompany growth.</p>

                <p>Huh. </p>

                <p>It seems like I, for the first time in a long while, am meta-thinking!</p>
