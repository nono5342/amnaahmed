        <h1 class="accent">who am i?</h1>
        <p>my name is amna ahmed, and this is my little corner on the internet.</p>
        <p>i am a sudanese computer scientist in the making, and an enthusiast for everything front-end. i enjoy design, programming, and writing, and this website is a creative space where i combine all three. </p>
        <p>here, you can find my projects, writing, links to my social media, and random little bits of me.<p>		</p>
        <h1 class="accent">what do i do?</h1>
        <p>i learn stuff, make stuff, and have a great deal of fun while at it.</p>
        <p>i'm a self-taught front end web developer, currently experimenting with ux/ui design.</p>
        <p>as of 2022, i am a sophomore at ain shams university in egypt, studying at the faculty of computer and information sciences. i'm really enjoying university, and have met a lot of awesome people here (if you're here and you know me from uni, you're awesome!).</p>
        <h1 class="accent"> يا مرحبًا</h1>
        <p>i'm a native arabic speaker, but i also speak and write english fluently, and a little bit of a few other languages (french, german, korean, and japanese).</p>
        <p>language fascinates me, but evidently not enough for me to reach fluency in a third language. had i not pursued computer science, i would've probably studied linguistics.</p>
        <h1 class="accent">the end ! </h1>
        <p>thank you for sticking around this far! i hope this website is as fun for you to browse as it was for my to make.</p>
        <p>i'll see you around!<p>
