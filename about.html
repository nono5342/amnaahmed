        <h3>about me :</h3>

        <p>hi there! my name is amna ahmed, and this is my little corner on the world wide web.</p>
        <p>i am a computer scientist in the making, and an enthusiast for everything front-end. i enjoy design, programming, and writing, and this website is a creative space where i combine all three. here, you can find my projects, writing, links to my social media, and random little bits of me.<p>		
        <p>i'm 19 years old and i come from sudan. i'm a native arabic speaker, but i also speak and write english fluently, and a little bit of a few other languages (french, german, korean, and japanese). language fascinates me, but evidently not enough for me to reach fluency in a third language. had i not pursued computer science, i would've probably studied linguistics.<p>
		<p>as of 2022, i am a sophomore at ain shams university in egypt, studying at the faculty of computer and information sciences. i'm really enjoying university, and have met a lot of awesome people here (if you're here and you know me from uni, you're awesome!).</p>			
        <p>thank you for sticking around this far. i hope this website is as fun for you to browse as it was for my to make.</p>
        <p>i'll see you around!<p>
